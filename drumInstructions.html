    <h1>Welcome to the Drum Viz App</h1>

    <p>
        This app aims to make it easier to understand musical notation for playing the drums, as well as learning pieces at your own pace.
    </p>
    <p>
        When the app loads you will see a musical score towards the top, some playback controls at the top right and a three-dimensional model of a drumkit in the main window.
        The playback controls allow the piece to be played at a particular tempo, denoted by the number in the centre of the dial.
    </p>

    </div>

    <p>
        This can be altered by either dragging the dial round to the desired location or using the mousewheel to increase/decrease the tempo.
        If you press the play button then the piece will start and you'll see a red line move across the score denoting where abouts in the bar the piece is currently playing.
    </p>

    <p>
        You can pause the recording at any time by clicking on the pause button and you may reset the piece back to the beginning by clicking rewind.
    </p>
    <p>
        As the piece progresses you'll also notice that the particular drum being played is identified on the 3D drumkit by a small, red sphere above the relevant drum.
    </p>

    <p>
        This is designed to offer further
        aid in the playback as you can identify which drums are being played at each particular note.
    </p>
    <p>
        The drop down menu beneath the playback controls denotes which score is being played, the full title of which appears above the score whenever you select a different piece.
        In the default setting there are three scores that may be played, each with a subtle variation of the others.
    </p>
    <p>
        Further pieces will be added in time, along with a number of updates and features.
